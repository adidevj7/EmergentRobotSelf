# Data Availability

This project’s primary artifacts for reproducing the reported analyses are the included model checkpoints
and selected state/plot assets stored within this repository.

If additional large artifacts (e.g., full training logs, large video sets) are needed for extended replication,
they can be hosted externally and referenced here
